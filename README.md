Keyboard Shortcuts
-

The extension allows for numberous keyboard shortcuts to speed up development:

* Ctrl + Shift + E - opens the extension popup 
* Up - manually increases browser width
* Down - manually decreases browser width
* Ctrl + 1-0 - resizes to saved preset
* Ctrl + Shift + 1-0 - resizes to the landscape/inverse of saved preset
* Ctrl + Esc - resets browser window to 1200x800

Cmd is substituted for Ctrl on Mac.

NOTE: Because Cmd + Shift + 3 and Cmd + Shift + 4 on a Mac take a screenshot, landscape orientarion for the devices in position 3 and 4 won't work on a Mac.
